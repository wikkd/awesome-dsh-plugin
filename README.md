English | [中文](README.zh.md)

> A curated list of plugins for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`).

DeepSeek Harness is DeepSeek's open-source agent harness — a runnable coding agent (Web and headless), built on a framework where everything is a plugin: models, tools, sandboxes, session storage, UI, even the agent loop itself. Plugins can extend the official coding agent, swap out its core parts, or assemble something entirely different.

This list collects community plugins that are installable via `dsh plugin add` (each declares a `dsh.bundle` manifest).

> 💡 New here? Install [dsh-find-plugin](https://github.com/awesome-dsh-plugin/dsh-find-plugin#readme) first — then just ask your agent to find plugins for you: `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-find-plugin`
